# fs-music-instrument-filter

In this workshop, you will build a music instrument filter with JavaScript.

Step 1
You have been provided with a page containing several instrument cards. You are going to add functionality to this static page so you'll be able to filter the instruments depending on their family.

Start by creating a dropdown menu with the class of select-container.

Step 2
Now add four options to your dropdown, All, Woodwinds, Brass, and Percussion, in this order. For each option, use the lowercase option to specify the id attribute and the value attribute.

Step 3
Before starting to add the filter functionality to your page, link your script.js file to the HTML.

Step 4
Declare an empty array named instrumentsArr.

Step 5
instrumentsArr is going to hold an object for each of your instrument cards. Each object will have the keys category, instrument, and price.

Add a first object representing the flute to your array. For the values use woodwinds, Flute, and 500, respectively.

Step 6
Add another two objects to your instrumentsArr to represent the remaining woodwinds instruments, clarinet and oboe.
